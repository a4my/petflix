# petflix 🐕🖥

This repository contains the files of one of my silly projects: Petflix! 😁 This project is supposed to be a Netflix homepage clone.

This project has parts that are mainly hard-coded and you cannot add watch any movies or create an account. This is more of a HTML / CSS type of project.

My goal with this project was to build my own project from scratch to practice HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is responsive on any devices.
